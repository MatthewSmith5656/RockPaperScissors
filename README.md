Rock Paper Scissors

run RockPaperScissors Funtion
Run front end
play via http request(postman or otherwise)

typically like devops wiki

basic postman pack attached, includes basic tests(could be more extensibly written)

backlog:


Login social or az b2c
Authorization JWT validated on APIM
Game persistence => stats, match history ect
p2p => made available by logic in back-end, but I would use a durable function as it's stateful. 
front end can store session data like games won whilst logged in(in basic form while app open)
Dockerize
unit test coverage 100%
a front end
