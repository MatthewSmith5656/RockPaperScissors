Rock Paper Scissors in 3 hours

Run RockPaperScissors Azure Funtion

Play using api calls in postman after importing the postman collection



basic postman pack attached, includes basic tests(could be more extensibly written)

backlog:

Authorization: JWT validated on APIM, claims leveraged in function
Login social or az b2c
Game persistence => stats, match history ect
p2p => made available by logic in back-end, but I would use a durable function as it's stateful. 
front end can store session data like games won whilst logged in(in basic form while app open)

unit test coverage 100%

create packages
Dockerize& devops

Change game logic to algorithm
