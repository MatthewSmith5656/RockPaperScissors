Rock Paper Scissors in 3 hours

Run RockPaperScissors Azure Funtion

Play using api calls in postman after importing the postman collection

typically like devops wiki

basic postman pack attached, includes basic tests(could be more extensibly written)

backlog:

Authorization: JWT validated on APIM, claims leveraged in function
Login social or az b2c
Game persistence => stats, match history ect
p2p => made available by logic in back-end, but I would use a durable function as it's stateful. 
front end can store session data like games won whilst logged in(in basic form while app open)

unit test coverage 100%

create packages
Dockerize& devops

Change game logic to algorithm
